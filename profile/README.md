# KtaneModules

This organization holds backups of source codes of modules for the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes intented to use for reuploads.

When a module is uploaded to the [Repository of Manual Pages](https://ktane.timwi.de) with its source code being publicly available on GitHub, a clone of it will be created in this organization.

The default branch of every repository is a branch for the workflow that updates the source code (pulls in changes) daily (named "updater_workflow"). Every other branch is a clone of the branch from the original source code with the same name (for ex. `master` -> the `master` branch of the module). Licenses of the mods are also mirrored from the original source code, staying in the same branches.

The [ModuleCloner](https://github.com/KtaneModules/ModuleCloner) repository is the source code of the app used to create these clones.

If you have any questions or issues, please contact Qkrisi#4982 on Discord. (Please join the [KTANE Discord server](https://discord.gg/ktane) before that so I can see where you're from, a friend request I most likely won't accept.)

Happy modding! :pineapple:
